　 　 绿色 象征 生命 ， 红色 象征 热情 ， 黄色 是 收获 之色 ， 紫色 代表 高贵 … … 颜色 之间 也 要 一争 高下 ， 比比 谁 更 重要 。 斑斓 世界 ， 五颜六色 ， 一个 也 不能 少 。 看 那雨后 的 彩虹 ， 也许 你 会 因此 而 相信 唯有 手拉手 ， 肩并肩 ， 才能 创造 出 美丽 和 希望 。 热爱 自己 ， 珍惜 他人 ， 明天 更 美好 。 　 　 Once   upon   a   time   the   colors   of   the   world   started   to   quarrel . 　 　 All   claimed   that   they   were   the   best .   The   most   important .   The   most   useful .   The   favorite . 　 　 Green   said : 　 　 " Clearly   I   am   the   most   important .   I   am   the   sign   of   life   and   of   hope .   I   was   chosen   for   grass ,   trees   and   leaves .   Without   me ,   all   animals   would   die .   Look   over   the   countryside   and   you   will   see   that   I   am   in   the   majority . " 　 　 Blue   interrupted : 　 　 " You   only   think   about   the   earth ,   but   consider   the   sky   and   the   sea .   It   is   the   water   that   is   the   basis   of   life   and   drawn   up   by   the   clouds   from   the   deep   sea .   The   sky   gives   space   and   peace   and   serenity .   Without   my   peace ,   you   would   all   be   nothing . " 　 　 Yellow   chuckled : 　 　 " You   are   all   so   serious .   I   bring   laughter ,   gaiety ,   and   warmth   into   the   world .   The   sun   is   yellow ,   the   moon   is   yellow ,   the   stars   are   yellow .   Every   time   you   look   at   a   sunflower ,   the   whole   world   starts   to   smile .   Without   me   there   would   be   no   fun . " 　 　 Orange   started   next   to   blow   her   trumpet : 　 　 " I   am   the   color   of   health   and   strength .   I   may   be   scarce ,   but   I   am   precious   for   I   serve   the   needs   of   human   life .   I   carry   the   most   important   vitamins .   Think   of   carrots ,   pumpkins ,   oranges ,   mangoes ,   and   papayas .   I   don ' t   hang   around   all   the   time ,   but   when   I   fill   the   sky   at   sunrise   or   sunset ,   my   beauty   is   so   striking   that   no   one   gives   another   thought   to   any   of   you . " 　 　 Red   could   stand   it   no   longer   he   shouted   out : 　 　 " I   am   the   ruler   of   all   of   you .   I   am   blood   -   life ' s   blood !   I   am   the   color   of   danger   and   of   bravery .   I   am   willing   to   fight   for   a   cause .   I   bring   fire   into   the   blood .   Without   me ,   the   earth   would   be   as   empty   as   the   moon .   I   am   the   color   of   passion   and   of   love ,   the   red   rose ,   the   poinsettia   and   the   poppy . " 　 　 Purple   rose   up   to   his   full   height : 　 　 He   was   very   tall   and   spoke   with   great   pomp :   " I   am   the   color   of   royalty   and   power .   Kings ,   chiefs ,   and   bishops   have   always   chosen   me   for   I   am   the   sign   of   authority   and   wisdom .   People   do   not   question   me !   They   listen   and   obey . " 　 　 Finally   Indigo   spoke ,   much   more   quietly   than   all   the   others ,   but   with   just   as   much   determination :   " Think   of   me .   I   am   the   color   of   silence .   You   hardly   notice   me ,   but   without   me   you   all   become   superficial .   I   represent   thought   and   reflection ,   twilight   and   deep   water .   You   need   me   for   balance   and   contrast ,   for   prayer   and   inner   peace . " 　 　 And   so   the   colors   went   on   boasting ,   each   convinced   of   his   or   her   own   superiority .   Their   quarreling   became   louder   and   louder .   Suddenly   there   was   a   startling   flash   of   bright   lightening   thunder   rolled   and   boomed .   Rain   started   to   pour   down   relentlessly .   The   colors   crouched   down   in   fear ,   drawing   close   to   one   another   for   comfort . 　 　 In   the   midst   of   the   clamor ,   rain   began   to   speak : 　 　 " You   foolish   colors ,   fighting   amongst   yourselves ,   each   trying   to   dominate   the   rest .   Don ' t   you   know   that   you   were   each   made   for   a   special   purpose ,   unique   and   different ?   Join   hands   with   one   another   and   come   to   me . " 　 　 Doing   as   they   were   told ,   the   colors   united   and   joined   hands . 　 　 The   rain   continued : 　 　 " From   now   on ,   when   it   rains ,   each   of   you   will   stretch   across   the   sky   in   a   great   bow   of   color   as   a   reminder   that   you   can   all   live   in   peace .   The   Rainbow   is   a   sign   of   hope   for   tomorrow . "   And   so ,   whenever   a   good   rain   washes   the   world ,   and   a   Rainbow   appears   in   the   sky ,   let   us   remember   to   appreciate   one   another .
